## Description
Within the past year, food banks across the country have reported a 40% increase in the need for emergency food assistance. To help cater to this need, we thought of Excessible. Excessible allows food banks to send a request to a grocery of items that they are need of or allow a grocery store to send an announcement of food they are no longer in need of. Based on their inventory, the grocery store or food bank can choose to accept the request , and the foodbank can pick it up from its nearest one. To do this, we have provided a map that the food bank/grocery store can look at and decide which to choose.To build our platform we used JavaScript, HTML, React,
Firestone and Google APIs. 

## Challenges we ran into
While coding, we ran into many problems with getting the API to function exactly in the way that we wanted. There were numerous bugs and default settings that hindered our progress, but we were eventually able to overcome them through much debugging. We are proud that we were able to work through our bugs, especially on the back-end with saving user information, and logging it. This took us a long time to maneuver and understand, so we are really happy that we ended up getting it to work. On the Google Maps front, we learned how to load and integrate 

## Future steps
Since surplus items are contingent on expiration dates, we want to include an object detection framework to label different grocery items and keep track of expiration dates in our database. In addition, merging trips to/from food banks by optimizing delivery times would help reduce the number of trips and save on CO2 emissions. Lastly, if independent donors want to get involved, they can keep track of their receipts with an embedded scanning application.


## Set up and Scripts


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
